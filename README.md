You can install the package via composer:

Register the plugin in your `AdminPanelServiceProvider`:

```php
use Automations\FilamentAutomations\FilamentAutomationsPlugin;

->plugins([
    FilamentAutomationsPlugin::make()
])
```

## Usage
### Basics
In order to let your models use automations, you need to add the `InteractsWithAutomations` trait to your model. By adding this trait, the plugin will automatically add a global observer to your model. So when ever a automation matches the event and trigger conditions, the automation will execute the actions.

### Add the trait to your model
```php
use Automations\FilamentAutomations\Concerns\InteractsWithAutomation;

class User extends Model {
  use InteractsWithAutomation;
}
```

### Create an Action
In order to attach an action to your automations, you will have to create a class within the `App\Jobs\Actions` folder. The class must extend the `BaseAction` class. This requires you to implement the `handle` method. This method will be called when the automation is executed.

The action class is very similar to a job.
When ever the action get executed, the model will be passed to the `__construct` method. You can use the model to do whatever you want.

The plugin will find this class on its own. So you don't have to register it anywhere.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Jobs\AutomationActions;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Automations\FilamentAutomations\AutomationActions\BaseAction;

class TestAction extends BaseAction
{
    public User $user;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    public function handle(): void
    {
        \Log::info($this->user->name . ' was created at ' . $this->user->created_at);
    }

    public function getActionName(): string
    {
        return 'Azione di prova';
    }

    public function getActionDescription(): string
    {
        return 'Descrizione';
    }

    public function getActionCategory(): string
    {
        return 'Default';
    }

    public function getActionIcon(): string
    {
        return 'heroicon-o-adjustments';
    }
}
```
